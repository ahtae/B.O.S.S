# B.O.S.S.

B.O.S.S. is a React Native application that is intended to help bridge the racial wealth gap and strengthen local economies. It provides consumers the ability to browse and search for black-owned businesses that they can support. Business owners can also add themselves and their businesses.

To run our application, go [here](https://expo.io/@teamhackerdelta/BOSS) and click 'Open project in the browser', or if you have an Android phone, scan our QR code to load the application immediately.

**_ The comments are not real or reflective of the businesses shown. They are simply there for demonstrative purposes. _**
